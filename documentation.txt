DOCUMENTATION


"VIEW"
- view = one window (not part of another window)
- contains handlers for loading and logic



SYSTEM-ARCHITECTURE

- "heavy-module-system"
	-> everything is a module / object
	-> e.g. menubar-functions (open >open-new, open->open_recent, preferences->settings->general, ...) are functions
		-> defined in classes
		-> to add new function:	- new class extending "MenuFunction"
								- set parameters, define functions
								- add to Menu directly of load with classloader (if external file / plugin)
								
	=> goal: make everything extendable, plugin-friendly (loadable with classloader)
		

- "divide ui and logic"

	-> package "ui" / frontend
		-> view
			-> controller: handles ui; recieves events; changes layout
			-> service: direct ui-logic only! (e.g.: sort lists) ; reads/writes data from LogicInterface

	-> package "logic" / backend
		-> handles, works on data data
		-> LogicInterface: interface between back and frontend
			-> add LogicServices to LogicInterface
